# Tabulanil' Sanity for DnD5e

A simple FoundryVTT module to add insanity to your games. Compatible with DnD 5e v3.0 running on FoundryVTT v11.

> Note: This module was created with my table's homebrew rules in mind.
> General customization was not the initial main goal of this module, while it may be in the future.

## Documentation

WIP

## Roadmap

While this module was intended for personal use, there are some things I would like to add in the future:

- Recovery of sanity on Rest
- Compatibility with other Actor sheet types (Legacy Player sheet, Tidy 5e Sheet)
- Sanity based Rolls
- Ways to customize the Insanity thresholds
- Optional Sanity for NPCs
